# This-Burns
🥗 The Burn Rate (TBR)Stop counting calories. Start counting life.The Burn Rate is an Android application that translates abstract nutritional data into Human Activity Units. Instead of showing you a number like "400 calories," TBR tells you exactly how many hours of your life that food fuels—whether you're just existing, walking the dog, or gaming.🚀 The ConceptMost people don't know what a calorie "feels" like. This app gamifies nutrition by converting food energy into time-based metrics using the MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) formula:$$\text{Time (mins)} = \frac{\text{Calories}}{(\text{MET} \times 3.5 \times \text{Weight in kg} / 200)}$$✨ FeaturesLENS Scanner: Instant barcode and AI image recognition for food items.The Life-Clock: Displays how many hours you could survive on a specific snack if you were just lying in bed (Basal Metabolic Rate).Activity Swapper: Toggle between different "burn" activities (Running, Gaming, Scrubbing Floors, Walking).Personalized Metabolism: Syncs with Android Health Connect to use your real weight and activity data for precision.The "Worth It?" Gauge: A visual indicator comparing the pleasure of the snack to the "cost" in movement.🛠️ Tech Stack (2026 Edition)Language: KotlinUI: Jetpack Compose (Declarative UI)Core: Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Room)Intelligence: Google ML Kit (Barcode Scanning) & Gemini Flash API (Food Recognition)Data: Nutritionix API & Health Connect🗺️ Development RoadmapPhase 1: The Foundation (MVP) 🏗️[ ] User Onboarding: Profile setup (Weight, Age, Sex).[ ] Core Engine: Implementation of the MET calculation logic.[ ] Manual Entry: Users can type in a calorie count to see the "Time-Units" instantly.Phase 2: The Vision 👁️[ ] Barcode Integration: Scan store-bought items via Google ML Kit.[ ] API Connectivity: Live fetching of nutritional data from Nutritionix.[ ] Basic Activity List: Walking, Running, and "Existing" (BMR).Phase 3: AI & Customization 🧠[ ] Image Recognition: Take a photo of a plate of food (no barcode) to estimate calories.[ ] Custom Activities: Add "Niche" burns (e.g., "Hours of VR Gaming" or "Mowing the Lawn").[ ] Health Connect Sync: Automatically update user weight from smart scales/Fitbit.Phase 4: Social & Gamification 🏆[ ] "Burn Challenges": Challenge friends to "Walk off a Pizza."[ ] Weekly Insights: "This week you fueled 14 hours of hiking."[ ] Home Screen Widgets: Quick-scan from the Android home screen.
